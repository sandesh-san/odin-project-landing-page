# odin-project-landing-page

This is an assignment of the Odin Project : The landing page.

## About Project 
This is a website template created as part of the Odin project Foundation level assignment. The odin project provided a [webpage template](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) that we needed to recreate using only HTML and CSS. [The color and font](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png) specifications are also provided by the odin project.The Project helped me to understand the basic concepts of HTML and CSS especially the flex-box model.The webpage works in desktop/large screens and doesn't work properly in small/mobile screens, working on the code to make appropriate changes.
